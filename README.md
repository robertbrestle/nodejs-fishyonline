# Fishy Online
A competetive online multiplayer aquatic life simulator built using HTML5 and websockets.

# Controls
WASD or Arrow keys to move  
Space to activate abilities (if available)  
Escape to focus on the game screen  

# Gameplay
The goal is to become the largest creature in the game. This can be achieved by eating fish smaller than you or eating the food pellets that rain down.

# Creatures
There are a few types of aquatic creatures you can play as.

## Fish
Quick, nimble, and great for collecting food swiftly. Upon eating another creature, fish will drop some uneaten food, which is only edible to bottom feeders.

## Crab
This nifty bottom feeder can swiftly collect scraps raining down from the fish above. Crabs cannot swim too far above the ground, keeping them safe from larger fish above.

## Jellyfish
Jellyfish are significantly slower than fish or crabs, making it harder for them to escape fast preditors. When near the ground, jellyfish can transform into polyps, rooting and making them immune to being eaten. Polyps can still grow from consuming any falling food.

## Clam
The humble clam provides you with a relaxing experience to chill and chat with friends. Clams cannot move nor have any special abilities, but they are completely immune to being eaten. They still can consume any falling food to increase in size.
